## About

This project is a visual tribute to Mark Rothko's color field paintings. It demonstrates how to use HTML and CSS to build geometric, layered color compositions reminiscent of Rothko's signature style.

## Features

- Pure HTML and CSS — no JavaScript required
- Responsive layout
- Customizable color fields and arrangement
- Clean, easy-to-read code for learning and experimentation

## How It Works

The painting is built using HTML elements styled with CSS. Each colored block is a div with its own background color, dimensions, and positioning to emulate Rothko’s abstract art.
